Here is a list of stuff i want to implement, in no particular order:
    - simplification of terms with approximate value, e.g.:
        set prop a > c
        set prop a > d
        set prop b > c
        set prop b > d
        x = a * b + c * d
         => x == a * b
        This is easy to resolve since we have to product of two big numbers and the product of two small numbers. This becomes harder if we mix individual terms. 
        This will need some kind of level of aggresiveness.

    - plot tool to show (qualitively) how the result behaves with regard to frequency/component values/...
        This of course needs numeric values as start, here one could work with a bunch of default values (say the gate cap is always around this value...)
    
    - Implement transfer functions for all voltage nodes but also for all currents so that impedances are possible too

    - Implement a result selection filter where the wanted values (can also include values which have to be calculated) are specified

    - Implement S-parameter simulation

    - Implement subciruits
        This could be combined with making transistors available: there should be a standard set of transistor models (only gm; gm and rout; gm, rout and cgs; etc.) that can be selected via commandline switch.
        This could be useful to re-simulate in different complexity without changing the netlist

    - Implement naming of components:
        R 1 0 R0   <-- before
        R1 1 0 R0  <-- after
        Not present names will be auto-assigned

    - Implement string names for nets, not only unsigned integers:
        R 1 0 R0       <-- before
        R vin vgate R0 <-- after

    - Enhance readability of output, similar perhaps to sympy. Also improve (and implement correctly) the latex report, because this provides the best output.

    - Add a utility to generate matlab/octave files in order to postprocess the results.
