[ ] Support n-port parameters (Z, Y, S, ABCD, ...)
[ ] Fully support spectre netlists
[ ] Implement Noise simulations
[ ] Integrate simplification from Jan, improve
[ ] Enhance readability of output, similar perhaps to sympy. Also improve (and implement correctly) the latex report, because this provides the best output.
[ ] Add a utility to generate matlab/octave files in order to postprocess the results.
[ ] plot tool to show (qualitively) how the result behaves with regard to frequency/component values/...
